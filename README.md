C Programming 20465 2021b mmn 14
The project was written as part of the course "20465 - Laboratory in Systems Programming" in my degree (Computer Science at the Open University). The purpose of the project was to experiment with writing a large software project, which would mimic the operation of one of the common system programs. This project is an assembler, for an assembly language that was defined in the course. The project is written in C and runs on a Linux operating system, as required.
